## The "Project"
### Artist statement
 Every once and awhile, we could use a change of scenery. Have you ever thought of going somewhere but unwilling to see it through? Going somewhere else other than we need to be. IF we desire to escape from where we are, but (if we) are restricted, does that mean it is impossible? It doesn't have to be. In many ways, having a change of scenery is important and beneficial.
 
### My statement :
To say that travelling is good for you. We should consider it at some point in our lives, having a different scenery. Different atmosphere. A change of pace. Of course, my statement is not to declare that travelling is a must, it's a matter of you should consider it and make effort to travel. For your own benefit.

## Objectives
To indulge people to go outside and more while exploring and seeing new things. Giving people exciting and motivation for the people that do have an interest on the outside.

## Justification
### Overview
 In my own opinion, Malaysian lacks the motivation to go anywhere. In recent research and discovery, we rarely step outside much. Malaysian has less than 4,000 steps daily. We don't go out as much. Let it be money or time, it's no excuse that we don't get out as much. So in my opinion, this should be recognized and be aware.

Every day in our lives we do daily routines at work, classes or others. Doing the same thing every day for a week, months and eventually years. Being stuck in this loop can be exhausting to both physically and mentally. To a certain extent, might even affect your psychological state. According to a study in American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, over 44,000 people try to commit suicide each year in the United States alone. Due to many reasons, one of which is being stuck in a dead-end job with boring routines.
 
### Definition on Travellin
 Most of us don’t need an explanation for this. For the sake of argument, I will have this section explained. Travelling, in simple terms, going on a journey from one place to another. Travel is the movement of people between relatively distant geographical locations and can involve travel by foot and etc. In conclusions, travelling is to go from one place to another, as by car, train, plane, or ship; take a trip; journey.

### Background Research
 Every single time, humans will bond to something that will give us a sense of relief. Either endlessly checking your smartphones, video games, gambling, or it might be even drugs. We will bond to something because that is our human nature. Travelling is one of which many ways to help people who are in need a change of scenery.

Travelling is, in many ways, healthy. It is even has been proven scientifically. With many proofs, data and results that have been written down as facts. None of us needs encouragement when it comes to jetting off somewhere nice and taking a break from the hustle and bustle of modern life, but it just so happens that there are more and more reasons emerging to take that oh so coveted vacation.

Travelling is scientifically proven to be healthy in a multitude of ways. There are many facts that have been proven to be true scientifically that travelling is good for your health.

Of course, travelling can also be negative towards some individuals, that’s just how complicated humans are. I as a human myself knows that. Despite all that, I believe that we still need a way to discover and reinvent ourselves. One of the best ways of doing so is to go outside and explore. Searching answers in and about life. Travelling can be risky, dangerous, but it is worth it in my opinion.

### Significance
 Travelling is important as a means of escape. In many ways, travelling helps us adapt to our life a lot more than expected. With enough planning, patience, passion and motivation, I believe anyone can travel. As long as they are willing to. Sometimes, being in just one place can be a negative thing. For example, we Malaysians have a saying, it reads; “Katak di bawah tempurung.” It means, that living without knowing what’s outside. Of course staying at one place could mean that you can still know of the outside thanks to our current age of technology, but what is shown is not the same as what we see for ourselves. We interpret the truth by ourselves is better than what we’re being told.
