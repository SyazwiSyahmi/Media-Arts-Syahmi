## The "Project"
Artist statement
 Every once and awhile, we could use a change of scenery. Have you ever thought of going somewhere but unwilling to see it through? Going somewhere else other than we need to be. IF we desire to escape from where we are, but (if we) are restricted, does that mean it is impossible? It doesn't have to be. In many ways, having a change of scenery is important and beneficial. 
 
 My statement :
To say that travelling is good for you. We should consider it at some point in our lives, having a different scenery. Different atmosphere. A change of pace.
Of course, my statement is not to declare that travelling is a must, it's a matter of you should consider it and make effort to travel. For your own benefit.

## Objectives
To indulge people to go outside and more while exploring and seeing new things.
Giving people exciting and motivation for the people that does have an interest on the outside.

## Justification
### Overview
 In my own opinion, Malaysian lacks the motivation to go anywhere. In recent research and discovery, we rarely step outside much. Malaysian has a less than 4,000 steps daily. We don't go out as much. Let it be money or time, it's no excuse that we don't get out as much. So in my opinion, this should be recognized and be aware.

 Everyday in our lives we do daily routines at work, classes or others. Doing the same thing everyday for a week, months and eventually years. Being stuck in this loop can be exhausting to both physically and mentally. To certain extent, might even affect your psychological state. According to a study in American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, over 44,000 people try to commit suicide each year in the United States alone. Due to many reasons, one of which is being stuck in a dead-end job with boring routines.
