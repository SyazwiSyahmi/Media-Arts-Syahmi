### The "Project"
Artist statement
 Every once and awhile, we could use a change of scenery. Have you ever thought of going somewhere but unwilling to see it through? Going somewhere else other than we need to be. IF we desire to escape from where we are, but (if we) are restricted, does that mean it is impossible? It doesn't have to be. In many ways, having a change of scenery is important and beneficial. 
 
 My statement :
To say that travelling is good for you. We should consider it at some point in our lives, having a different scenery. Different atmosphere. A change of pace.
Of course, my statement is not to declare that travelling is a must, it's a matter of you should consider it and make effort to travel. For your own benefit.
